### **Xinyang (Sean) Feng**

#### **PROJECT TITLE: Dynamic Prediction Models For Tooth Loss Incorporating Longitudinal Tooth-level Predictors**

Xinyang is a PhD student in Biostatistics at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto. His research interests focus on the development of dynamic prediction models that fully incorporate changes in longitudinal predictors, with the ability to account for within-cluster correlation in complex multilevel data.

### **Zijin Liu**

#### **PROJECT TITLE: High-dimensional Mediation Analysis Methods for Identifying Causal Pathways from COVID-19 Related Policy Changes to Radiotherapy Adverse Events**

Zijin is a biostatistics PhD student at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto. He completed his MMath degree in statistics from the University of Waterloo. His research interests focus on integrating machine learning/artificial intelligence methods into the causal inference framework and developing Bayesian statistical methodologies for clinical or public health applications.
