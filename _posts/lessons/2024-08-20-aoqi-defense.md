**Abstract**: Given substantial public resources allocated to health research, it is crucial to ensure the resources are used effectively so that it maximizes the benefit. A pilot study is a small-scale study
that aims to test for feasibility to ensure a high likelihood of success for a large-scale trial. Sample
size re-estimation allows modification of the final sample size based on interim results, ensuring
sufficient power are maintained. Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trials (SMART)
provide a framework for testing dynamic treatment regimens, which are pre-specified rules for rerandomizing participants based on their responses. However, there is a gap for combining these
two methods within Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trials. In this study, we aim to
extend the fixed SMART design to include an Internal Pilot Study for feasibility and unblinded
Sample Size Re-estimation (SSR).
The SMART trial proceeds in two phases. In Phase I, we conduct an internal pilot study to
assess trial feasibility using a one-stage exact test. Following this, we compare three methods for
SSR based on interim efficacy data from the internal pilot: (1) Traditional; (2) Adjusted Effect
Size (AES); and (3) the Cui, Hung, Wang (CHW) method. In Phas II, the large-scale main trial
proceeds with re-estimated sample size. To evaluate our proposed design, we assess the statistical
properties of our proposed adaptive design with internal pilot and SSR methods and the fixed
design (without the feasibility test or SSR) in terms of expected re-estimated sample size, type I
error rate, and statistical power using a simulation study.
The internal pilot study saves the interim sample size (half of the total planned sample size)
compared to the external pilot study design, and prevents infeasible study from continuing till the
end. Results show that all SSR methods have the same or higher power than the fixed design,
across all scenarios. All methods recover the power compared to the fixed design when the true
effect size is smaller than planned. The CHW method generally performs better with sufficient
power and requires a smaller sample size.
By integrating an internal pilot study, we enhance feasibility and study design reliability before
full-scale deployment. The use of SSR addresses key challenges in maintaining power and ethical
standards, allowing trials to adapt to emerging data, optimize resources, and accelerate treatment
development. The improved design will be instrumental in supporting the ethical and cost-effective
execution of SMART.
