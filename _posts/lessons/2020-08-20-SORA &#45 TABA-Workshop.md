**Dr. Noah Simon** from the University of Washington will present a 1-day intensive workshop. You’ll learn about how traditional statistical methods like logistic regression can be used for high dimensional data (data with many variables) and then move onto machine learning methods such as random forests, support vector machines, (gradient) boosting using trees and neural networks. New machine learning methods will be related to more classical statistical approaches – all designed for an audience with familiarity with statistical approaches and discussed in the context of biomedical big data and predictive modeling.
