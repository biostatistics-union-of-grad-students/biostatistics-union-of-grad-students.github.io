On January 21, 2025, BUGS hosted a highly engaging **Job Hunting Q&A Session**, featuring two inspiring speakers: **Marija**, a 2024 graduate, and **Ashley**, a 2020 graduate of the MSc Biostatistics program at the University of Toronto.

Both guests shared valuable insights about their job-hunting journeys, including how they secured their roles, detailed tips for navigating the process, and advice on what’s most important when transitioning from academia to the workforce. They also discussed their current roles—Marija at SickKids Hospital and Ashley at Roche—providing a glimpse into the practical applications of biostatistics in healthcare and clinical trials.

The event began with introductions of our speakers, followed by Marija and Ashley sharing short overviews of their experiences. We then moved into a Q&A session in a lecture-style format, where students had the opportunity to ask questions directly. After 30 minutes, we transitioned to a more interactive format, splitting the room into two groups so attendees could ask personalized questions to the speaker of their choice.

The session lasted two hours, and even after it officially ended, attendees were eager to stay and continue asking questions. Our wonderful guests generously provided their contact information, allowing for further discussions beyond the event.

This event was a resounding success, providing attendees with practical advice, inspiration, and valuable connections to help guide their own career paths.

# Our Speakers

### Marija
Marija earned her Master’s in Biostatistics from the Dalla Lana School of Public Health in 2024. She completed her practicum at Public Health Ontario, where she worked on predictive modeling of respiratory diseases. Marija now works at SickKids Hospital, focusing on identifying risk factors for asthma and pulmonary function.

### Ashley
Ashley works as a biostatistician at a pharmaceutical company, Roche. She graduated from the Biostatistics program at the University of Toronto in 2020. During her studies, she gained valuable hands-on clinical trial experience through a practicum at Roche. Following graduation, Ashley completed an 8-month internship at Roche before transitioning to a full-time role in early 2021. Currently, Ashley specializes in clinical trials within the therapeutic area of immunology, contributing to advancing innovative treatments with robust statistical design and quantitative support. Outside of work, Ashley enjoys playing board games, exploring new restaurants, and traveling.
