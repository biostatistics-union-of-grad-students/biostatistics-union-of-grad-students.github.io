**Event**: Lunar New Year & Valentine's Social

**Time**: 4:30pm-6:30pm (EDT)

<!--more-->

Once everyone arrives, we will create smaller breakout rooms and give everyone the ability to move to around different rooms so that you can get a chance to socialize with everyone.

We also encourage you to **change your Zoom backgrounds to something Lunar New Year or Valentine's themed** to help create the setting.
