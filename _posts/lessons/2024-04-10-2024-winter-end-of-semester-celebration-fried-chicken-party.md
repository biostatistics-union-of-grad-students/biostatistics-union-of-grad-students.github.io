**End of Semester Celebration: Fried Chicken Party**

We're thrilled to share that we've successfully wrapped up the semester with our delightful **End of Semester Celebration, affectionately known as the Fried Chicken Party.** We received an overwhelming response with more than 70 registrations, bringing together master's students, Ph.D. students, and alumni in a joyful reunion to celebrate the conclusion of the academic term.

**Thank you to everyone who came out to celebrate with us!** It was a fantastic gathering, filled with laughter, shared stories, and of course, delicious fried chicken.

Our students just completed their survival analysis final exam, and we hope you're all feeling a sense of relief. For those who still have projects and exams on the horizon, we're sending our best wishes your wayâ€”good luck!

This event was a beautiful way to mark the end of a challenging but rewarding semester. It was not just about the joy of coming together but also celebrating the hard work, dedication, and achievements of our students. The Fried Chicken Party has become a tradition that everyone looks forward to, and this year's event did not disappoint.

We look forward to creating more memorable moments like this in the future. Until next time, take care and stay connected!
