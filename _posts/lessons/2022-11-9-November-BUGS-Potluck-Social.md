Hello DLSPH biostatistics students!
 
It’s Eric again from the BUGS exec team, messaging to inform you of the Potluck Social Event taking place this November! This is to make up for October’s cancelled Halloween potluck, and BUGS is happy to have settled the date for the new event. Come join us on Thursday, November 24th from 4:30pm-7:30pm, in HS700 (the seventh floor student lounge).
 
Here’s what’s in store for the evening! 
* Potluck: You’re encouraged to bring food you would like to share with others at the event! Home-baked goods, or just one of your favourite purchased snacks.
* Games: Feel free to bring any board/card games you’d like to play with your colleagues while we hang out in the lounge!
All of the above are optional – you will be welcomed with open arms if you arrive empty-handed 😊
 
Note we have decided to drop the costume part of this event, since it is no longer occurring in Halloween season. We’re excited to see everyone’s costumes next Halloween though! 
See you soon! 

Eric
