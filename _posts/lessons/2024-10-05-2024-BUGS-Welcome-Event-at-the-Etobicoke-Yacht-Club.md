As the evening settled in, we lit a **bonfire**, which added a cozy atmosphere to the gathering. Everyone gathered around to warm up, share stories, and relax in the beautiful setting. To top it all off, we enjoyed **delicious pizza** as the main meal, which was a big hit with everyone.

The event provided a wonderful opportunity for students and faculty to unwind, connect, and build lasting memories as we kicked off the 2024-2025 year together.

**Thank you to everyone who made this event so special!** Weâ€™re looking forward to organizing more exciting events like this one throughout the year.
