Hello DLSPH biostatistics students!

Itâ€™s Eric again from the BUGS exec team, messaging to inform you of the Potluck Social Event taking place this November! This is to make up for Octoberâ€™s cancelled Halloween potluck, and BUGS is happy to have settled the date for the new event. Come join us on Thursday, November 24th from 4:30pm-7:30pm, in HS700 (the seventh floor student lounge).

Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s in store for the evening! 
* Potluck: Youâ€™re encouraged to bring food you would like to share with others at the event! Home-baked goods, or just one of your favourite purchased snacks.
* Games: Feel free to bring any board/card games youâ€™d like to play with your colleagues while we hang out in the lounge!
All of the above are optional â€“ you will be welcomed with open arms if you arrive empty-handed ðŸ˜Š

Note we have decided to drop the costume part of this event, since it is no longer occurring in Halloween season. Weâ€™re excited to see everyoneâ€™s costumes next Halloween though! 
See you soon! 

Eric
