BUGS hosted an informal information session on scholarships and funding opportunities for biostatistics students within the Dalla Lana School of Public Health. Primarily, we provide information on the main federal and provincial scholarships: NSERC, CIHR and OGS/QEII. This session is relevant for both domestic and international students.

Unlike more general workshops offered by the university that focus on proposal writing, we want to provide you this information through a biostatistics student’s perspective. Our goal is to equip you with all the sufficient information in time for the scholarship deadlines in September/October and encourage you all (if not, then most) to apply for these awards.

In the 1-hour information session, we’ll be going through general information in the first 40 minutes, followed by 20 minutes of informal Q&A. Three current biostatistics PhD students will be present to share their experiences.

Sumeet Kalia, Year 4 (NSERC)

Erik Lovblom, Year 3 (CIHR)

Thai-Son Tang, Year 3 (QEII)
