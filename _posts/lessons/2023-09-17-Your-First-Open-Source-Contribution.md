**Description**: Are you a student with some experience in programming? Do you want to explore the world of open-source contributions and understand the magic behind collaborative coding on platforms like GitHub? If so, this workshop is tailored just for you!

Join us for an interactive session with Larry, a GitHub Campus Expert and biostatistics PhD student, who will guide you step-by-step to make your very first open-source contribution using GitHub integrated within RStudio or via the command line. By the end of this workshop, youâ€™ll not only have a deeper understanding of the open-source community but also the confidence to contribute to it.


**All are welcome!**
