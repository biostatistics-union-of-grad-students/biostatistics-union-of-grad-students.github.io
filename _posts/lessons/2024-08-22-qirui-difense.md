**Abstract**: Basket designs and Multi-Arm Multi-Stage (MAMS) trials enhance efficiency in evaluating multiple
treatments across various indications. Chen et al. (2016) proposed a 2-arm 2-stage randomized bassket design, testing l=1 treatment vs. control. We expand this to evaluate multiple treatments (l>1)
vs. a common control. This multi-arm, 2-stage design is broadly applicable and features rigorous
scientific and statistical design. We extended Chen’s statistical calculations and used simulations to
evaluate type I error rate, power and sample size. We applied the Dunnett test to prune inactive
indications in the interim analysis and pool active indications in the final analysis. We compared
Chen’s 2-arm design with our multi-arm design, validating the accuracy of our simulation approach
and effective type I error control. The proposed design maintained stable power with smaller sample
sizes compared to single treatment trials, providing a foundation for broader analytical applications.
This design offers an efficient method to evaluate multiple therapeutic approaches within a single
trial, enhancing the identification of effective treatments across various indications.
