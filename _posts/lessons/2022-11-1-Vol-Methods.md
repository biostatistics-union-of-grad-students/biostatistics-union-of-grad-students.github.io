Dear BUGS,

Prof. Anna Heath ( https://www.dlsph.utoronto.ca/faculty-profile/heath-anna/; https://lab.research.sickkids.ca/heath/) will be giving an informal presentation on her current research and opportunities for students (incl. thesis and research projects and RA etc), and you are invited to join us tomorrow  (November 1) afternoon, 3-4pm, in HSB 790.   

Prof Heathâ€™s research focuses on developing new, innovative statistical methods to design, prioritise and analyse clinical research within a Bayesian framework. She is particularly interested in applying methods from decision theory, the science of determining the best course of action when the consequence of each action is uncertain, to the conception, design and analysis of clinical trials. She has projects focusing on both applied and theoretical developments for clinical trial design.

See you tomorrow.

Wendy
