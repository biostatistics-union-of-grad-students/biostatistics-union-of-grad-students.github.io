            <p class="lead"> The Biostatistics Union of Graduate Students (BUGS) was founded by biostatistics students
              for biostatistics students. Our mandate is to represent the interests of the students within our
              department and the school, as well as to provide a sense of community for our students. Our executive team is
              made up of student volunteers and our monthly meetings are open to all students who wish to help out.

            <p class="lead"> BUGS and the Biostatistics Division encourage students to have work-life balance. In this respect, BUGS
              holds various social events throughout the year to encourage students to take some time out of their
              coursework for a little fun. In the past, we have organized various social events for both the students
              and faculty, including picnics, potlucks, board game/movie nights and Halloween/holiday parties.

            <p class="lead"> In addition to social events, BUGS organizes a student-led seminar series that is aimed at
              providing tools that students feel would benefit them. Students are encouraged to suggest ideas for
              possible seminar topics, as well as to volunteer to present such topics. Our introductory R and SAS
              seminars, held at the beginning of every school year, are open to all public health graduate students.
              Since the biostatistics program admits students from a wide spectrum of backgrounds, these seminars aim to
              teach the basic coding skills needed in our program so that no student feels left behind.

            <p class="lead"> BUGS wishes everyone a great school year, and hopes to see everyone at the next event!
